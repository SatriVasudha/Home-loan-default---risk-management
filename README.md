# Home-loan-default---risk-management
1.	Binary classification problem
2.	Objective:  Use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan.
3.	Target is the dependent variable. 
0 - will repay loan on time, 
1 - will have difficulty repaying loan.
4.	EDA and data preprocessing – Converting categorical columns to numeric
            Aggregating numeric columns
            Finding and imputing missing values
            Correlation heat map
            Merging all csv files into a single file
5.	Feature selection – Chi-square test considering 1000 best features out of 1186 features
6.	Modelling – Logistic Regression
        Random Forest classifier
        XGBoost
        LGBM classifier
        Deep Learning
7.	Model Evaluation – 

            Model Name	                 Accuracy
            Logistic Regression	          92.01%
            Random Forest classifier	  91.8%
            XGBoost	                  92.03%
            LGBM classifier	          92.18%
            Deep Learning	          92.04%

	After comparing the performance of all the above techniques,  LGBM classifier performs the best followed by the Deep Learning neural network classifier.
